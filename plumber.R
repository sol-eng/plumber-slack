#' This asset shows how [`plumber`](https://www.rplumber.io) can be used to 
#' build a [Slack slash command](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands). The API 
#' is built on top of a [simulated customer dataset](customer-data-sim.Rmd) that 
#' contains details about customer call history. The slash command provides 
#' access to customer status report as well as customer success rep reports 
#' directly from within Slack. The goal of this integration is to highlight the 
#' strengths of `plumber` and how it can be used to *reliably and securely 
#' integrate R with other products and services*.
#'
#' ![](images/slash-command-preview.png)
#' 
#' The API for this command is hosted on the [colorado demo server](http://colorado.rstudio.com/rsc/connect/#/apps/1292/access).
#' 
#' ## Usage
#' Instead of registering a different command for each endpoint, the first
#' argument provided to the slash command is the endpoint while the subsequent
#' argument(s) (if necessary) provide additional data to be passed to the
#' specified endpoint. This way, a single slash command serves multiple endpoints
#' without polluting the slash command namespace.
#' 
#' To access a customer status report, enter `/cs status <id>` in Slack, where
#' `id` is a valid customer ID from the simulated data. The customer status report
#' includes the customer name, total calls, date of birth, and a plot call totals
#' for the last 20 weeks. The color of the message is an indication of customer
#' health. Green indicates the customer has no issues while red indicates the
#' customer has a high volume of calls, indicating a potential problem.
#' 
#' Help for all available commands can be accessed by entering `/cs help` or
#' simplly `/cs` into Slack.
#'

#' 
#' ## Getting Started
#' In order to build a Slack app, you must have a Slack account and [follow the
#' directions](https://api.slack.com) for creating a Slack app. The app will be
#' tied to a specific workspace, so select a Slack workspace you anticipate
#' belonging to long term. By default, your app will only be available to this
#' workspace, although it's possible to expand access to the app later on.
#' 
#' Once the app has been created in Slack, create a new slash command through
#' which the end user will interact with the app.
#' 
#' ![](images/slash-command-creation.png)
#' 
#' Specific details for building slash commands can be found [here](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands).
#' This will be a helpful reference through the remainder of the walk through.
#' 
#' ## Plumbing the API
#' If you haven't already, install the `plumber` package via `install.packages
#' ("plumber")`. The [`plumber.R`](plumber.R) file uses `plumber` to define all
#' of the API filters and endpoints leveraged by the Slack app. Here, we'll go
#' through each piece of the API to describe the code and introduce helpful
#' resources.
#' 
#' In this scenario, we're building an API that interacts with a known request.
#' That is, we must build the API so that it can properly handle the request that
#' comes from Slack. This is different from building an API that others will write
#' requests for because in this instance, we have no control over the request.
#' Instead, the API must be designed to properly interact with the Slack request.
#' In order to promote this type of development, it is helpful to know how Slack
#' makes requests and what is contained in those requests. [This section](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands#app_command_handling)
#' of the Slack documentation contains helpful details about the request Slack
#' makes in response to a slash command. In short, the request contains a url
#' encoded data payload containing details about the slash command that was
#' invoked. An example request looks like the following:
#' 
#' ```
#' token=gIkuvaNzQIHg97ATvDxqgjtO
#' &team_id=T0001
#' &team_domain=example
#' &enterprise_id=E0001
#' &enterprise_name=Globular%20Construct%20Inc
#' &channel_id=C2147483705
#' &channel_name=test
#' &user_id=U2147483697
#' &user_name=Steve
#' &command=/weather
#' &text=94070
#' &response_url=https://hooks.slack.com/commands/1234/5678
#' &trigger_id=13345224609.738474920.8088930838d88f008e0
#' ```
#' 
#' Due to the way `plumber` handles data from incoming requests, there are two
#' methods we can use to access this data within the API. First, this data will
#' be parsed and arguments matched to the functions defined in the API. So, we
#' could write a function that takes `user_name` as an argument and the `user_name`
#' value from the request data would be passed into the function by `plumber`
#' automatically. The other method is to access the entire data of the request
#' using `req$postBody`. With this information in mind, we are prepared to start
#' creating our API filters and endpoints.
#' 
#' ### Setup
#+ api-setup
# Packages ----
library(plumber)
library(magrittr)
library(ggplot2)

# Data ----
# Load sample customer data. IRL this would likely be housed in a database.
sim_data <- readr::read_rds("data/sim-data.rds")

# Config options ----
# Base URL for API requests
base_url <- config::get("base_url")

# Utils ----
slack_auth <- function(req) {
  # Verify request came from Slack ----
  if (is.null(req$HTTP_X_SLACK_REQUEST_TIMESTAMP)) {
    return("401")
  }
  
  base_string <- paste(
    "v0",

    req$postBody,
    sep = ":"
  )
  
  # Slack Signing secret is available as environment variable
  # SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
  computed_request_signature <- paste0(
    "v0=",
    openssl::sha256(base_string, Sys.getenv("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET"))
  )
  
  # If the computed request signature doesn't match the signature provided in the
  # request, return an error
  if (!identical(req$HTTP_X_SLACK_SIGNATURE, computed_request_signature)) {
    "401"
  } else {
    "200"
  }
}

#* @apiTitle CS Slack Application API
#* @apiDescription API that interfaces with Slack slash command /cs

#' Here we setup the environment for the API by loading the appropriate packages
#' and loading the simulated data. The [`config`](https://github.com/rstudio/config) 
#' package is used to store parameters that change based on the location of the
#' API (if it's local or deployed on RStudio Connect). `slack_auth()` is a helper
#' function that is used to confirm that incoming requests are indeed coming from
#' Slack and not an unauthorized source. Details about authenticating Slack requests
#' can be found in [Slack's documentation](https://api.slack.com/docs/verifying-requests-from-slack).
#' Essentially, Slack provides a signing secret that is known to us (the app
#' developers) and Slack. This signing secret is used in combination with request
#' details to calculate a signature for each request. That signature is
#' verified in `slack_auth()` to ensure that the request came from Slack.

#+ comments-1, include=FALSE
# Requests sent from Slack slash commands are sent as url encoded text in the
# postBody of the request. The text of the command is contained in the text
# field. Full details of what is sent from Slack can be found at
# https://api.slack.com/slash-commands

# req$postBody is either decoded as JSON if it appears to be JSON or it is
# decoded as a standard query string. Fields provided in the post body in
# either format will be matched to function parameters.
# see https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#request-body

# Slack uses the notion of signed secrets in order to verify that the request
# was actually made from Slack. This API checks the signed secret against
# a self computed signed secret to ensure they match. If not, an error is
# returned. Detailed instructions for verifying requests can be found
# at https://api.slack.com/docs/verifying-requests-from-slack
# TODO: Is it possible to reject requests from bad actors based on a history
# of incorrectly signed requests? Or is just rejecting the incorrectly signed
# request enough?
# Authentication happens at the endpoint level so that each endpoint MAY have
# it's own method of authentication.

# This filter is responsible for parsing text, routing to the appropriate
# endpoint, and providing arguments to be consumed by that endpoint

#' ### `@filter route-endpoint`
#+ filter-route-endpoint
#* Parse the incoming request and route it to the appropriate endpoint
#* @filter route-endpoint
function(req, text = "") {
  # Identify endpoint
  split_text <- urltools::url_decode(text) %>%
    strsplit(" ") %>%
    unlist()
  
  if (length(split_text) >= 1) {
    endpoint <- split_text[[1]]
    
    # Modify request with updated endpoint
    req$PATH_INFO <- paste0("/", endpoint)
    
    # Modify request with remaining commands from text
    req$ARGS <- split_text[-1] %>% 
      paste0(collapse = " ")
  }
  
  if (req$PATH_INFO == "/" & slack_auth(req) == "200") {
    # If no endpoint is provided (PATH_INFO is just "/") then forward to /help
    req$PATH_INFO <- "/help"
  }
  
  # Forward request 
  forward()
}

#' This filter is responsible for parsing the `text` field of the incoming request
#' and routing the request to the appropriate endpoint. Additional details provided
#' in `text` are added to the request object (`req`) as `req$ARGS`. This filter
#' also routes authorized requests made to `/` to the `/help` endpoint. This way,
#' someone in Slack can simply enter `/cs` to get help for the command. Unauthorized
#' requests aren't forwarded so that Swagger documentation for the API is available
#' when the API is published to RStudio Connect.

#' ### `@filter logger`
#+ filter-logger
#* Log information about the incoming request
#* @filter logger
function(req){
  cat(as.character(Sys.time()), "-",

  # Forward request
  forward()
}

#' This filter is lifted straight from the [`plumber` docs](https://www.rplumber.io/docs/routing-and-input.html#filters).
#' It simplly logs information about incoming requests and is helpful when
#' troubleshooting API performance and behavior.

#' in the messages we return to Slack, and Slack just views this as an image URL
#' to which it makes a `GET` request. Additional work needs to be done in order
#' to ensure that only authorized requests can be made to this endpoint so that 
#' customer history isn't easily accessed by anyone. Also, note that this endpoint

#' 
#' ## Running Locally
#' Interacting with these APIs locally can be a bit of a challenge since most
#' require data to be passed in the request body. It's also a challenge to mimic
#' the request as it is sent by Slack, especially when it comes to mimicking the
#' authentication mechanism. While traditional tools like [`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se)
#' can be used, I've found that [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) is a powerful 
#' and easy to use tool for interacting with APIs. Postman can even leverage
#' pre-request JavaScript code to mimic the authentication mechanism employed
#' by Slack. For example, I use the following JS code to mimic Slack authentication
#' in local testing:
#' 
#' ```js
#' // Define function for creating URI string from data object
#' // Lifted from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14525178/is-there-any-native-function-to-convert-json-to-url-parameters
#' function urlfy(obj) {
#'   return Object
#'   .keys(obj)
#'   .map(k => `${encodeURIComponent(k)}=${encodeURIComponent(obj[k])}`)
#'   .join('&');
#' }
#' 
#' // Set timestamp of request
#' var date = new Date()
#' var timestamp = date.getTime()
#' pm.globals.set("SLACK_TIMESTAMP", timestamp);
#' 
#' // Build rawBody using urlfy
#' var rawBody = urlfy(request.data)
#' var baseString = ["v0", timestamp, rawBody].join(":")
#' // console.log(baseString)
#' 
#' // Calculate signature
#' var signature = ["v0=", CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(baseString, pm.globals.get("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET"))].join('')
#' //console.log(signature)
#' 
#' // Set SLACK_SIGNATURE variable
#' pm.globals.set("SLACK_SIGNATURE", signature)
#' ```
#' 
#' The entire Postman collection I use for interaction with the API is contained
#' in the [`postman-api-collection.json`](postman-api-collection.json) file. This
#' collection can be imported into Postman and used to interact with the API either
#' locally or remotely.
#' 
#' ## Deployment
#' As mentioned, this API is deployed on RStudio Connect on the colorado demo
#' server. Deployment is done through the publish button in the RStudio IDE. A
#' vanity URL was used and then passed into the Slack app settings so that Slack
#' knows where to send requests.
